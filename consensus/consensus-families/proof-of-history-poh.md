# Proof-of-History (PoH)

## Basic definition

the idea is to create a historical record to prove that an event has occured at a specific moment in time.

Verifiable delay function = function that takes a prescribded time to compute, even on parallel computation and whose output can be quickly and publicly verified

## Solana

Solanaâ€™s implementation uses a sequential pre-image resistant hash that used the previous step output as the next step input. For a SHA256 functio, the process cannot be parallelized without a bruteforce attack of 2128 cores. Also uses Tower BFT
