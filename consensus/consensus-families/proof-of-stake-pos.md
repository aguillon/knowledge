# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

## Basic definition

Validators must invest in some quantity of blockchain tokens. Validators will validate blocks by betting on it if they discover a block that they suppose can be added to the blockchain.

Depending on which blocks are added to the blockchain, all validators receive a proportionate reward to their bets, meaning their stake increase accordingly. Meaning, if a system has 1000 tokens and a validator stakes 100 tokens (staking 10% of all tokens), then the validator has 10% chance of winning every award

This requires a potential attacker to acquire a large portion of the blockchain tokens to mount an attack, thus mitigating attacks by design.

## Features of PoS

* energy efficient

## Disavantages

* double-spent attack (doesnâ€™t cost anything to mine on multiple chains and before the transaction is confirmed, the tokens are spent again)
