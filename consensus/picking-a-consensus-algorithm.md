# Picking a consensus algorithm

## Censorship resistance versus selective censorship

Nodes should be able to submit operations, and to make an analogy with real life, people should be able to express LGBT-stance online even if their surroundings are utterly homophobic or transphobic or political critism from activists in a totalitarian regime.

This is why,  a blockchain \(actually, any system really\) is, ideally, censorship-resistant: users should be able to submit any and all operations to the network.

However, complete neutrality is not something that is inherently good or desirable: it's not because someone has an idea that this idea isn't shitty, morally doubtable or fraudulent. Indeed, most groups of people deem certain views as taboo and forbidden, for instance genocide denial point of views or pro-pedopornography opinions are often banned. This constitutes selective censorship.

The ability for a node to perform selective censorship is desirable in order to prevent one's instance from hosting hate-speech.
