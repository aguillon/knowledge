### What attacks the voting committee can endure if it is predictable?

**Question** Algorand stresses extensively on making it hard to predict the voting committee. What attacks the voting committee can endure if it is predictable?

**Answer** Bribing attacks: if  you know the $$k$$ people who will decide the next blocks you can just bribe them instead of having to bride 51% (or 34%) of the network.

This is a theoretical attack, it hasn't been witnessed and probably shouldn't be considered a big deal.
