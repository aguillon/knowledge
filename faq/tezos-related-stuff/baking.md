# Baking

### During a cycle how do I know how many blocks (among the 4096 ones) I will bake as a baker? Does it change at each cycle?

**Question** I have to hold a certain amount of tez to be eligible to became a baker or a validator (endorser?), but during a cycle, how do I know how many blocks (among the 4096 ones) I will bake as a baker, does it change at each cycle?

**Answer** It's decided $$k$$ cycles in advance. The order is decided on chain, with a deterministic shared-randomness process.
