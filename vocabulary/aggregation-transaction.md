# Aggregation (transaction)

&#x20;One of the many challenges of blockchains is scalability. A scalability enhancement is **aggregation.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Transaction aggregation is a blockchain scalability enhancement used to reduce the size of the blockchain. This process allows multiple valid transactions between a sender and a receiver to be visible as a single transaction on the blockchain.
{% endhint %}

Aggregation is one of the key features of a blockchain and is not part of consensus.
