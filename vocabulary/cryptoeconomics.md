# Cryptoeconomics

Cryptoeconomics is the study of economics interactions in adversarial environments.

The idea is that in decentralized peer-to-peer systems, you must assume that some of the actors are actively trying to disrupt the system.  The main challenge in cryptoeconomics is to the create decentralized P2P systems that thrive despite the prensece of adversaries and to find good incentives that make actors willing to contributed positively to the network.
