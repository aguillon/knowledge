# Leader/Leaderless

V**alidators** decide which transaction are valid:

* through election, validators vote on the transaction they believe is real
* through random selection, validators randomly select the valid transaction
* through stake delegation, users stake currency on validators they trust and top-ranked validators select the transaction they believe is valid
* through other mecanism

## Features

* fast

## Disadvantages

* attackers could take over the majority of validators and manipulate the blockchain&#x20;

To increase security, you'll have to increase the number of validators, which results in increased time and complexity for transactions to be validated.
