# Sybil attacks

Type of attack in which a node operates multiple indentities at the same time in order to undermine the authority/power in the network. The goal is to gain the majority of influence in the network to carry out illegitimate actions while respecting the protocol and rules in place.

1. Direct Sybil Attack: the nodes are under the direct influence of one or several Sybil nodes
2. Indirect Sybil Attack: the nodes are attacked through a compromised node under the influence of a Sybil node

In permissionless networks, an adversary can create an arbitrary number of pseudonyms AKA Sybil nodes. It is impossible to rely on traditional consenusus that require  a fraction of honest users.
